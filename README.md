Hi there! This is my personal web page built using flask. 
Visit the page, email me any comments or suggests, connect with me on linkedin! 

Facial detection is surprisingly easy to run, as long as opencv (the python library that does all the heavy lifting of running facial recognition algorithms) 
is setup correctly in the computer or server environment. 

Please try to upload an image file (jpg, jpeg, png) and see if I can detect any faces or eyes in the image!
